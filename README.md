README FILE FOR GUESS THE ELEMENT GAME.

This is a simple game that helps us to remember the periodic table.

The first version of the game is written using tkinter in Python.
The repository also includes the flow-chart used for organising code 
and for future reference.

Screenshots are included depicting the flow of the game.

Possible to-do includes:
1. integrate image using Canvas.
2. refactor code
3. properly comment code.
4. use better layout.
5. use better colors and borders.
6. add sound effects.
7. expand the game to include stuff like electronic configuration,
fun fact about elements etc.
8. add level-wise playing modes (easy, medium, hard)
9. please inform me how to write better README files.
